style: element class id > merge to a table 
so element do not need style, just need class
No, still need style, for animation, rotation 
# learn-love
## TODO
1. card show select play
2. color: RGB and RGBA
2. practice some animation principle, stretch, anticipation

## note
- use `Array:push`, DO NOT use `Array.push`
- `__index`: when the key not found in table, search the key in __index
- to debug in vscode, use `tomblind.local-lua-debugger-vscode`
- vertex_position: love shader only render vertex in [-1,1], -1 is near, 1 is far  
left is x+, up is y+, inward is z+, so that's a **left-hand coordinate**,  
 but in glTF, models are placed in right-hand coordinate, 
- mat in glsl is column-major
- lua 5.1
- lÃ–ve 11.5
> Conditionals (such as the ones in control structures) consider `false` and `nil` as false and `anything else` as true. Beware that, unlike some other scripting languages, Lua considers both zero and the empty string as true in conditional tests.
